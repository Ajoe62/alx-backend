# 0x01-caching
Caching is a technique used to store (or "cache") data temporarily so that future requests for that data can be served faster. Instead of recalculating or fetching the data from a slow source (like a database or a remote server), you keep a copy of the data in a faster storage (like memory).

1. Caching is a way to store data temporarily to access it faster.
2. It helps improve the performance and efficiency of your application.
3. A basic cache can be implemented using a dictionary in Python.
4. You put data into the cache and get data from the cache using simple methods.
